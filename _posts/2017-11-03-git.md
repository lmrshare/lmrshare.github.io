最近算法原型接近尾声，开始为落地项目做些准备工作，下面就是我这段时间看网课学的一些命令

### Mon Oct 30 19:04:02 CST 2017

首先，po出一些与显示相关的命令：

    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git log -p
    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git log --stat
    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git log -p -w
    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git log sha
    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git show sha
    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git log --oneline
    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git log -p sha
    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git show : show the recent changes


### 一些命令的解释

> 1. git clone: copy an existing repository
> 2. git status: see the status of the repository
> 3. git log: review exixting commits
> 4. git add: Add files from working space to staging index
> 5. git commit: Take the files from staging index and save them in the repository which is what actually commit
> 6. git diff: Display the difference between two versions of a file

### Notes of lesson 1

You should have the command,git status, as your goal to run the git status command both before and after any other Git command. Let's do a quick review of what's going on and what we're about to do:

>1. we have some new files that we want Git to start tracking
>2. for Git to track a file, it needs to be committed to the repository
>3. for a file to be committed, it needs to be in the Staging Index
>4. the git add command is used to move files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index

eg:

    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git add index.html
    lmr@lmr-ThinkPad-T470-W10DG: git add css/app.css js/app.js

The command 'git add' . can be used as a shortcut to refer to all files and directories (including all nested files and directories!).

### Notes of lesson 2

see the details:

>1. git diff: This tool will tell us what changes we've made to files before the files have been committed
>2. git status will tell us what files have been changed, but not what those changes actually were
>3. "git add .": This command will commit all files
>4. touch project.docx
>5. git status
>6. touch .gitignore
>7. vim .gitignore

### Notes of lesson 3

see the details:

> 1. git tag: add tags to specific commits
> 2. git branch: Allow multiple lines of development.
> 3.             [Let you develop different features of your project in parallel without getting confused as to which commits belong
> 4.              to which feature]
> 5. git checkout: You will be able to switch between different branches and tags
> 6. git merge: Combine changes on different branches [Take change on different branches and combine them together automatically.]

create tag:

> 1. -git tag -a v1.0: create an annotated flag, and tag the most recent commit.
> 2. -git tag v1.0: create an lightweight tag
> 3. -git tag -a v1.0 a87984: 

verify tag:

> 1. -git tag
> 2. -git log --decorate

delete tag:

> 1. -git tag -d v1.0
> 2. -git tag --delete v1.0

### Notes of lesson 6

git branch:

> 1. -git branch: list branch names in the repository
> 2. -git branch sidebar: create a new branch called "sidebar"
> 3. -git checkout

annotated flag:

> 1. the person who made the tag
> 2. the date the tag was made
> 3. a message for the tag
> 4. tags are associated with a specific commit. This is why the tag is on the same line as the commit's SHA
